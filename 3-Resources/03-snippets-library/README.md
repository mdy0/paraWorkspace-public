# Snippets Library

Reusable snippets created from your emails, Slack messages, chats, and other sources (UC-4).

## What Goes Here

Text you've already written somewhere else that's worth preserving:
- Email responses that explain concepts well
- Slack messages with good examples
- Chat messages with interesting ideas
- Social media posts that resonated

## How to Use (UC-4)

**You say:** "Save this as a snippet" (with screenshot or text)

**Claude does:**
1. Extracts/reads the text
2. Creates: `snippet-topic-name.md`
3. Adds context (source, date)

---

## Format

Each snippet file should include:

```markdown
# Snippet: [Topic/Title]

**Source:** [Where this came from]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** [Why you saved this]

---

[The actual content]
```

## Difference from Project Snippets

- **Project snippets** (`1-Projects/[name]/04-snippets/`) = Written for specific project
- **Snippets library** (here) = Found/repurposed from existing writing

Both are valuable, just different origins!
