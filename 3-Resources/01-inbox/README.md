# Inbox

This is your capture zone. Everything lands here first.

## How It Works

Each capture is a **folder** with a date prefix: `YYYYMMDD-topic-name/`

Inside each folder:
- `idea.md` - The idea (if applicable)
- `source.md` (or .pdf, .txt, etc.) - Source materials (if applicable)

## Three Types of Captures

1. **Idea only** (UC-1)
   - Folder contains just `idea.md`

2. **Idea + Source** (UC-2)
   - Folder contains `idea.md` and source file(s)
   - Can add sources to existing ideas later!

3. **Source only** (UC-3)
   - Folder contains just source file(s)
   - For articles/materials to read/reference later

## Marination (UC-10)

Ideas can stay in inbox indefinitely. Return periodically to add thoughts:

```markdown
## Update 2025-11-10
[New thoughts added here]
```

## Processing the Inbox (UC-5)

Review regularly:
- **Keep marinating:** Ideas that need more development
- **Move to project:** Ready to work on → Create in `1-Projects/`
- **File source:** Read sources → Move to `02-sources/[Category]/`
- **Delete:** Not worth pursuing

## Tips

- Don't overthink it - just capture and process later
- Use descriptive folder names
- Date prefix keeps things chronological
- Everything-as-folder means easy additions later
